## Abstract
Urban land-use characteristics have been demonstrated to alter precipitation distribution and duration.  The lack of modeling-based examination of the interaction between urbanization and precipitation in Turkey, however, limits the understanding of urban-precipitation features. Here, we investigate the impact of the urban signature on two specific precipitation events in Ankara, the second-crowdest city in Turkey, using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Two rainfall occurrences with different synoptic backgrounds were selected from the spring and summer seasons, considering the intensity of the urban heat island (UHI) over the metropolitan area. Integrating the CORINE land cover data into the WRF model, we conceptualize urban and nourban configurations and run three simulations for each event using three different microphysics parameterization schemes and ensemble-average them. We observe that the impact of the urban signature on the springtime and summertime precipitation occurrences are different from each other. The urban scenario has boosted (suppressed) the precipitation amount by 14% (18%) over (upwind of) the city center, whereas there is almost no change observed for the springtime event. Consistent with the synoptic background of the selected events and the seasonal UHI climatology of the region, the increase in temperature (1.2°C) and sensible heat flux (+40W/m2) with urban land-use is greater for the summertime rainfall event. Our findings facilitate a better understanding of the alterations to individual precipitation periods in populated urban areas.
